## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the [SonnySangha](https://www.youtube.com/@SonnySangha) YouTube channel, which provided a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/tbvguOj8C-o) on how to build a LinkedIn clone using Firebase and React-Redux. The tutorial was followed closely to build the application, with some modifications made to suit the specific requirements of this project.
